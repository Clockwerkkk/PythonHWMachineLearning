The repository with all my Kaggle competition notebooks. The baseline models were provided by course Teaching team, my work was to improve given models

The idea behind posting all these notebooks is to show the fact that I have studied Machine Learning on Python and
have enough skills to complete complex tasks on this programming language. In fact, even being given the model to work with,
it requires understanding of the process in order to improve the final result. 

These homeworks were done in teams, so in the headers of files names of my teammates are written
